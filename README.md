# shift-scheduling-optimization
A project from Math Modeling Competition 2024

This repository contains our project for the 2024 Mathematical Modeling Contest, developed by team **DK Algebros**. The project addresses the employee shift scheduling problem using the **Simulated Annealing** algorithm to find an optimized work schedule under multiple real-world constraints.

## üìå Problem Statement

We are tasked with creating a 28-day schedule (from August 5 to September 1, 2024) for **8 employees** (4 full-time and 4 part-time), assigning them to either **morning** or **evening** shifts each day. The schedule must:
- Satisfy specific working hour quotas per employee.
- Ensure enough staffing per shift.
- Respect both hard and soft constraints related to fairness and workload balance.

## üß† Our Approach

We use the **Simulated Annealing (SA)** metaheuristic algorithm to search for optimal or near-optimal schedules. The SA process includes:
- Random schedule initialization.
- Cost function design (penalizing hard and soft constraint violations).
- Temperature-based acceptance of new solutions (including worse ones to avoid local minima).
- Repeated iterations with a cooling schedule until a stable solution is reached.

The cost function combines both **hard constraints** (e.g., required number of shifts) and **soft constraints** (e.g., preferred consecutive working days).

## üîç Results

We ran the simulation multiple times to find the best possible shift schedule. Among the best results:
- Hard constraint cost: **18**
- Extended solution with soft constraints: **29**

We also considered fairness and practicality in the final evaluation.
